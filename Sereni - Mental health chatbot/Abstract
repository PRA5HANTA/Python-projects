With the rising prevalence of mental health issues worldwide, many individuals struggle to access timely and effective support.
Barriers such as social stigma, high treatment costs, and a shortage of mental health professionals often discourage help-seeking behavior.
This project introduces Sereni, an AI-powered mental health chatbot designed to offer real-time emotional support.
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a finetuned conversational AI model, Sereni enables empathetic, context-aware conversations.
It provides users with a secure, anonymous, and judgment-free space to express their thoughts and emotions.
A key feature of Sereni is its integration with the DocVita platform, allowing users to seamlessly book therapy sessions without manual searching.
The system is built with strong privacy measures, ensuring no sensitive data is stored.
While not a replacement for clinical therapy, Sereni acts as a first-level support system, guiding users toward professional help when necessary.
This project aims to make mental health support more accessible, affordable, and immediate through intelligent AI interactions.
