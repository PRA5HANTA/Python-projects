With the rising prevalence of mental health issues worldwide, a significant number of individuals face challenges in accessing timely and effective support. Barriers such as social stigma, high treatment costs, and the limited availability of mental health professionals often prevent individuals from seeking help. This project presents an AI-powered mental health chatbot that provides real-time emotional support through empathetic, context-aware conversations, enabled by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a finetuned conversational AI model.
The chatbot offers users a secure, anonymous, and judgment-free environment to express their thoughts and emotions. A distinctive feature of the system is its integration with the therapist booking platform, DocVita, which enables a streamlined transition from self-help to professional consultation without manual searching. The system places a strong emphasis on user privacy, ensuring that no sensitive information is stored. While not a substitute for clinical therapy, the chatbot serves as an initial support mechanism, guiding users toward appropriate mental health resources when needed. This project aims to enhance the accessibility, affordability, and immediacy of mental health support through AI-driven digital interactions.
