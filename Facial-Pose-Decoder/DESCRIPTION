The Facial Pose Decoder is a machine learning project designed to analyze and interpret facial poses from images or live video feeds. By leveraging Python and computer vision libraries like OpenCV, this system detects key facial landmarks and decodes various facial orientations and expressions. Its potential applications include gesture recognition, emotion analysis, and enhancing user interactions in virtual environments. This project demonstrates the practical use of AI in bridging the gap between human expression and machine understanding.
